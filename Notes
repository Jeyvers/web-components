Web Components are a set of web platform API's that allow us to create custom, reusable and encapsulated html tags to use in web pages and web apps.
Web components do not require any special 3rd party libraries or frameworks but can certainly be used with them.
3 main  building blocks for web components are : 
- custom elements
- shadow DOM 
- HTML templates

a.
CUSTOM ELEMENTS 
- constructor(): Called when an instance of the element is created or upgraded
- connectedCallback(): Called every time when the element is inserted into the DOM 
disconnectedCallback(): Called every time the element is removed from the DOM
attributeChanedCallback(attributeName, oldValue, newValue): Called whn an attribute is added, removed, updated, or replaced.   

b. 
SHADOW DOM 
- Used for self-contained components 
- Encapsulate styles and markup
- Create with element.attachShadow({mode: open})
- Creates a "shadowRoot" that we can reference and interact with 

c. 
HTML TEMPLATES
- Define the encapsulated markup of our web component 
- Template tag stores markup on page 
- Include both HTML and CSS in templates 
- Use slots to add custom text
